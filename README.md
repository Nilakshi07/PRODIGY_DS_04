ðŸ’¢ I've just completed an insightful analysis of sentiment patterns in social media data, focusing on public opinions towards specific topics and brands.

 

ðŸš€Project Overview:

I utilized the Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis dataset from Kaggle, which contains approximately 74,000 labeled training messages and 1,000 labeled validation messages. Each message is associated with an entity and labeled as positive, negative, or neutral.



Key Steps Undertaken:

Data Loading and Inspection: Employed Pandas to load the dataset, inspect its structure, and identify key issues.

Data Cleaning: Addressed missing values, fixed data types, and handled outliers.



Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize relationships between variables.

Feature Engineering: Created new features to assess the impact of various factors on sentiment.



Modeling: Built and evaluated machine learning models to predict sentiment.



ðŸš€Key Insights:

Sentiment Distribution: The dataset exhibits a balanced distribution of sentiments, with a slight skew towards positive sentiments.



Entity-Specific Sentiments: Certain entities consistently receive positive or negative sentiments, indicating strong public opinions.



Temporal Trends: Sentiment towards specific entities fluctuates over time, reflecting public reactions to events.



ðŸš€Learning Outcomes:

Data Preprocessing: Enhanced skills in handling missing data, converting categorical variables, and managing outliers.

Visualization Techniques: Improved proficiency in using Seaborn and Matplotlib for effective data visualization.

Sentiment Analysis: Gained experience in analyzing and interpreting sentiment in textual data.

Model Evaluation: Developed the ability to build and assess machine learning models for classification tasks.
